# My Data Journey

Hi there! I'm starting my journey to learn Data Analysis from scratch, aiming to build a strong career in this field — especially in the middle of major shifts in the job market.

This repository will document my progress step by step. I'll be sharing my notes, small projects, and the resources I'm learning from.

## 🎯 Current Goals:
- Build a solid foundation in **Python**, **Pandas**, and **NumPy**
- Learn **SQL** for data analytics using BigQuery
- Organize my learning notes and keep everything as a personal reference

---

## 📚 Courses I'm Following:
- ✅ Data Analysis with Python (Zero to Pandas – Jovian)
- 🔄 Intuitive SQL for Data Analytics (freeCodeCamp)

---

## 📝 Repository Structure:
- `python_notes.md` → Notes and lessons on Python & Pandas
- `sql_notes.md` → Notes and practice for SQL
- `projects/` → Simple data analysis projects I’ll work on along the way

## ⏳ Personal Note:
> I believe discipline is more important than short bursts of motivation. Even if progress is slow, I’ll stay committed — consistency is the key.
